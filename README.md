## Autodrop

This module will automatically expand "dropbuttons" in drupal. It is
designed as a convenience make accessing drop buttons more efficient for
users with a mouse. It is not expected to have an effect on accessibility
for systems not using a pointing device.

### Contribution

Although the [Drupal.org issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/autodrop)
is being used for tracking tickets, PRs on [Github](https://github.com/Jaesin/autodrop)
will also be considered.

Tests should be written in [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/) for this
module moving forward wherever possible ([available since 8.6.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2869825)).
